# Generators 

    !py3
    def squares(numbers):
        for n in numbers:
            yield n*n


Lets try it out:


    !py3
    >>> for x in squares([1, 2, 3, 4]):
    ...     print(x)
    1
    4
    9
    16

# Generators

    !py3
    def squares(numbers):
        print("BEGIN squares")
        for n in numbers:
            print("Computing square of", n)
            yield n*n
        print("END squares")
 

Lets try it out:


    !py3
    >>> sq = squares([1, 2, 3])
    >>> sq
    <generator object squares at 0xb6c73720>
    >>> next(sq)
    BEGIN squares
    Computing square of 1
    1
    >>> next(sq)
    Computing square of 2
    4
    >>> next(sq)
    Computing square of 3
    9
    >>> next(sq)
    END squares
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      StopIteration

# Coroutines

    !py3
    def abc():                   def xyz():     
        print("A")                   print("X")
        yield                        yield
        print("B")                   print("Y")
        yield                        yield
        print("C")                   print("Z")
        yield                        yield  


    def main():
        g1 = abc()
        g2 = xyz()

        next(g1); next(g2)
        next(g1); next(g2)
        next(g1); next(g2)

Output:

    A
    X
    B
    Y
    C
    Z

# Coroutines


    !py3
    def display(values):
        for v in values:
            print(v)
            yield

    def interweave(generators):
        while True:
            for g in generators:
                yield next(g)
                 
    def run_all(generators):
        for x in interweave(generators):
            pass

    def main():
        run_all([display("ABC"), display("123")])


Output:
    
    A
    1
    B
    2
    C
    3

# Earlier Limitations

Until Python 3.3, it was not possible to:

* delegate control to a sub-generator
* return a value from a generator

--- 
# Delegate control to a sub-generator

    !py3
    def display2(values1, values2):
        """This doesn't work"""
        display(values1)
        display(values2)


The new construct `yield from` was introduced to sovle this:

    !py3
    def display2(values1, values2):
        yield from display(values1)
        yield from display(values2)

---

# Returning a value from a generator

    !py3
    def square(x):
        """Computes square of a numnber using square microservice.
        """
        response = send_request("http://square.io/", x=x)

        # It'll take a while to get the response data,
        # something else can run in the meanwhile.
        yield

        return response.json()['result']

Support for returning values from generators was added in Python 3.3.

 
    !py3
    def sum_of_squares(x, y):
        x2 = yield from square(x)
        y2 = yield from square(y)
        return x2 + y2

---

# Generators are overloaded

* Used to build and process data streams
* Also used as coroutines

Confusing!

---

# Native Coroutines

The new `async` and `await` keywords are introduced in Python language to make coroutines first class concepts in Python.

    !py3
    async def square(x):
        return x*x

    async def sum_of_squares(x, y):
        x2 = await square(x)
        y2 = await square(y)
        return x2 + y2

---

## Coroutine Protocol


    async def square(x):
        return x*x

Lets try it out:


    !py3
    >>> square(4)
    <coroutine object square at 0xb57a6510>

    >>> x = square(4)
    >>> x.send(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      StopIteration: 16

---
## Generator-based coroutines

It is still possible to use generator-based coroutines along with native ones. 
But they'll have to be decorated as coroutine.

    import types

    @types.coroutine
    def display(values):
        for v in values:
            print(v)
            yield 

    async def display2(value1, values2):
        await display(values1)
        await display(values2)

--- 

# Running Coroutines

    def run(coroutine):
        try:
            while True:
                coroutine.send(None)
        except StopIteration as e:
            return e.value
